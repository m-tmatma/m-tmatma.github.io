"Alternately, you can build Subversion directly from source code, though it's "

"<filename>INSTALL</filename> file to build it. Note that a released source "
"package may not contain everything you need to build a command-line client "

"later, the libraries Subversion depends on (apr, apr-util, and neon) are "

"installed on your system. If not, you'll need to unpack the dependency "
"package into the same directory where you unpacked the main Subversion "
"source. Regardless, it's possible that you may want to fetch other optional "

"<sidebar> <title>What's in a Name?</title> <para>Subversion tries hard not "

"<xref linkend=\"svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type\"/> tells you how to "
"give Subversion a hint that <quote>textual</quote> operations don't make "

"Subversion places restrictions on information it stores.</para> "
"<para>Subversion internally handles certain bits of data&mdash;for example, "
"property names, path names, and log messages&mdash;as UTF-8 encoded Unicode. "
"This is not to say that all your interactions with Subversion must involve "

"transparently handle conversions between UTF-8 and the encoding system in "
"use on your computer, if such a conversion can meaningfully be done (which "
"is the case for most common encodings in use today).</para> <para>In "
"addition, path names are used as XML attribute values in WebDAV exchanges, "
"as well in as some of Subversion's housekeeping files. This means that path "
"names can only contain legal XML (1.0) characters. Subversion also prohibits "
"TAB, CR, and LF characters in path names to prevent paths from being broken "
"up in diffs, or in the output of commands like <xref linkend=\"svn.ref.svn.c."
"log\"/> or <xref linkend=\"svn.ref.svn.c.status\"/>.</para> <para>While it "
"may seem like a lot to remember, in practice these limitations are rarely a "
"problem. As long as your locale settings are compatible with UTF-8, and you "
"don't use control characters in path names, you should have no trouble "
"communicating with Subversion. The command-line client adds an extra bit of "
"help&mdash;it will automatically escape illegal path characters as needed in "
"URLs you type to create <quote>legally correct</quote> versions for internal "
"use.</para> </sidebar> <para>Although the above example checks out the trunk "

"Additional tooling around this command is available, too. The "

"Some administrators use a different backup mechanism built around generating "

"to find your rules-file, it's time to define the rules.</para> <para>The "
"syntax of the file is the same familiar one used by <command>svnserve.conf</"

"Licensor are hereby reserved.\n"
"\n"
"4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly\n"
"   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n"
"\n"
"   a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\n"
"      publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this\n"
"      License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n"
"      Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of\n"
"      the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\n"
"      publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any\n"
"      terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this\n"
"      License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\n"
"      hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact\n"
"      all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\n"
"      warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly\n"
"      perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any\n"
"      technological measures that control access or use of the Work in\n"
"      a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License\n"
"      Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a\n"
"      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work\n"
"      apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of\n"
"      this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from\n"
"      any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from\n"
"      the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the\n"
"      Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,\n"
"      upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n"
"      practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to\n"
"      such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\n"
"\n"
"   b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\n"
"      publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or\n"
"      Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for\n"
"      the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the\n"
"      medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or\n"
"      pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the\n"
"      title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably\n"
"      practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that\n"
"      Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such\n"
"      URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing\n"
"      information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work,\n"
"      a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work\n"
"      (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or\n"
"      \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such\n"
"      credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,\n"
"      however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective\n"
"      Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other\n"
"      comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as\n"
"      prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\n"
"\n"
"5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n"
"\n"
"UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,\n"
"LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR\n"
"WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,\n"
"STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF\n"
"TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\n"
"NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,\n"
"OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n"
"DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED\n"
"WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n"
"\n"
"6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY\n"
"   APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY\n"
"   LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE\n"
"   OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE\n"
"   WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n"
"   DAMAGES.\n"
"\n"
"7. Termination\n"
"\n"
"   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n"
"      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this\n"
"      License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative\n"
"      Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,\n"
"      will not have their licenses terminated provided such\n"
"      individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those\n"
"      licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any\n"
"      termination of this License.\n"
"\n"
"   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted\n"
"      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright\n"
"      in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the\n"
"      right to release the Work under different license terms or to\n"
"      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that\n"
"      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or\n"
"      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted\n"
"      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue\n"
"      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n"
"\n"
"8. Miscellaneous\n"
"\n"
"   a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work\n"
"      or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a\n"
"      license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the\n"
"      license granted to You under this License.\n"
"\n"
"   b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a\n"
"      Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to\n"
"      the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the\n"
"      license granted to You under this License.\n"
"\n"
"   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable\n"
"      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or\n"
"      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,\n"
"      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,\n"
"      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary\n"
"      to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n"
"\n"
"   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and\n"
"      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in\n"
"      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver\n"
"      or consent.\n"
"\n"
"   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the\n"
"      parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no\n"
"      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to\n"
"      the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any\n"
"      additional provisions that may appear in any communication from\n"
"      You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\n"
"      agreement of the Licensor and You.\n"

"The problem with such FAQs is that they are not, in a literal sense, FAQs at "
"all. No one ever called the tech support line and asked, <quote>How can we "
"maximize productivity?</quote>. Rather, people asked highly specific "
"questions, like, <quote>How can we change the calendaring system to send "
"reminders two days in advance instead of one?</quote> and so on. But it's a "
"lot easier to make up imaginary Frequently Asked Questions than it is to "
"discover the real ones. Compiling a true FAQ sheet requires a sustained, "
"organized effort: over the lifetime of the software, incoming questions must "
"be tracked, responses monitored, and all gathered into a coherent, "
"searchable whole that reflects the collective experience of users in the "
"wild. It calls for the patient, observant attitude of a field naturalist. No "
"grand hypothesizing, no visionary pronouncements here&mdash;open eyes and "
"accurate note-taking are what's needed most."

"What I love about this book is that it grew out of just such a process, and "
"shows it on every page. It is the direct result of the authors' encounters "
"with users. It began with Ben Collins-Sussman's observation that people were "
"asking the same basic questions over and over on the Subversion mailing "
"lists: What are the standard workflows to use with Subversion? Do branches "
"and tags work the same way as in other version control systems? How can I "
"find out who made a particular change?"

"Frustrated at seeing the same questions day after day, Ben worked intensely "
"over a month in the summer of 2002 to write <citetitle>The Subversion "
"Handbook</citetitle>, a sixty page manual that covered all the basics of "
"using Subversion. The manual made no pretense of being complete, but it was "
"distributed with Subversion and got users over that initial hump in the "
"learning curve. When O'Reilly and Associates decided to publish a full-"
"length Subversion book, the path of least resistance was obvious: just "
"expand the Subversion handbook."

"The three co-authors of the new book were thus presented with an unusual "
"opportunity. Officially, their task was to write a book top-down, starting "
"from a table of contents and an initial draft. But they also had access to a "
"steady stream&mdash;indeed, an uncontrollable geyser&mdash;of bottom-up "
"source material. Subversion was already in the hands of thousands of early "
"adopters, and those users were giving tons of feedback, not only about "
"Subversion, but about its existing documentation."

"During the entire time they wrote this book, Ben, Mike, and Brian haunted "
"the Subversion mailing lists and chat rooms incessantly, carefully noting "
"the problems users were having in real-life situations. Monitoring such "
"feedback was part of their job descriptions at CollabNet anyway, and it gave "
"them a huge advantage when they set out to document Subversion. The book "
"they produced is grounded firmly in the bedrock of experience, not in the "
"shifting sands of wishful thinking; it combines the best aspects of user "
"manual and FAQ sheet. This duality might not be noticeable on a first "
"reading. Taken in order, front to back, the book is simply a straightforward "
"description of a piece of software. There's the overview, the obligatory "
"guided tour, the chapter on administrative configuration, some advanced "
"topics, and of course a command reference and troubleshooting guide. Only "
"when you come back to it later, seeking the solution to some specific "
"problem, does its authenticity shine out: the telling details that can only "
"result from encounters with the unexpected, the examples honed from genuine "
"use cases, and most of all the sensitivity to the user's needs and the "
"user's point of view."

"Of course, no one can promise that this book will answer every question you "
"have about Subversion. Sometimes, the precision with which it anticipates "
"your questions will seem eerily telepathic; yet occasionally, you will "
"stumble into a hole in the community's knowledge, and come away empty-"
"handed. When this happens, the best thing you can do is email "
"<email>users@subversion.tigris.org</email> and present your problem. The "
"authors are still there, still watching, and they include not just the three "
"listed on the cover, but many others who contributed corrections and "
"original material. From the community's point of view, solving your problem "
"is merely a pleasant side effect of a much larger project&mdash;namely, "
"slowly adjusting this book, and ultimately Subversion itself, to more "
"closely match the way people actually use it. They are eager to hear from "
"you not merely because they can help you, but because you can help them. "
